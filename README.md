ðŸ¤– AIAB: Reinforcement Learning with Prioritised Experience Replay
ðŸ“Œ Description:
This project investigates reinforcement learning, experience replay, and adaptive AI behavior in a grid-based simulation environment. It focuses on balancing exploitation and exploration to improve agent decision-making.

ðŸ“Œ Features:
âœ… Grid-based agent simulation with obstacles
âœ… Prioritised Experience Replay for faster learning
âœ… Q-learning implementation with exploration strategies
âœ… Performance evaluation across multiple episodes

ðŸ“Œ Tech Stack:

Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch
OpenAI Gym, NumPy, Matplotlib
Jupyter Notebook for visualization

ðŸ“Œ Results & Performance:

Faster adaptation using Prioritised Experience Replay
Optimized balance between exploration & exploitation
Performance charts and statistical analysis included
